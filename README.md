# Deep-Learning-for-EEG-Emotion-Classification
This repository contains a Python code script for performing emotion classification using EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. Emotion classification from EEG signals is an important application in neuroscience and human-computer interaction. The code leverages deep learning techniques to analyze EEG data and predict emotional states.
